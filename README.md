# multimodal_fake_news_detection 
We proposed a multimodal solution for the detection of fake News related to COVID-19 on the Twitter social network. This solution is based on the features extracted from text, image and social context modalities. Our solution consists of two fundamental phases: the extraction of textual and visual features using the «VilBERT» transformer model. Then, the binary classification of tweets according to the merged features of the textual, image and social context modalities. In the classification phase, we experimented three binary classifiers: SVM, FNN and CNN-1d. The results showed that the SVM classifier outperformed the other models with an Accuracy of 76% on the «Lesa» dataset, and an Accuracy of 77% on a part of the «MediaEval» dataset. The proposed solution gives a relative improvement compared to the existing work in the literature, which was tested on the same datasets.
